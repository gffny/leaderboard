Competition Hierarchy
---------------------
COMEPTITION PARENT has multiple CHILD COMPETITION
CHILD COMPETITION is an individual competition, which can be scored, published, or managed on its own
INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION can have sibling COMPETITION, which are scored seperately but organised identically
a comeptition parent must have child competitions which are scored the same way (as a team, or as an individual, but not mixed) - objects implement different interfaces

COMPETITION -> 1|* COMPETITION ROUNDS
COMPETITION SCHEDULER creates competition round but should not store state. Static methods that crunch numbers to produce model pojos

USE CASE ONE - RYDER CUP
Team competition played over four days
Mix of competition types but always team points scored

USE CASE TWO - PRESIDENT'S DAY CUP
Individual competition played over four days with individual day winners (and handicap changes per round)
Daily team competition played each day parallel to three/four balls played in the individual competition

Select available tee times for each day

abstract class CompetitionScheduler implements  	
//name - the name of the overall competition, individualCompetition - true if overall competition is individual, false if overall competition is team
public CompetitionScheduler

	//creates the instance of the competition scheduler	
	public CompetitionScheduler(String competitionName, boolean individualCompetition)

	//returns competition round id
	public int scheduleRound(Date roundDate, Array teeTimesArray, List competitorList, int playerGroupSize, int numberOfHoles)

	//returns an array of rounds for that day, though there should be only one
	public CompetitionRound[] getRoundByDate(Date roundDate)
	
	//returns the round for that id
	public CompetitionRound getRoundByID(int roundId)
